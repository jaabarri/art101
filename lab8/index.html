			<h1>LAB 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We were assigned to mess around with anonymous functions and callbacks</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Live Share was slow again. Also, it was a bit tricky to get te code right for anonymous function as a callback. On top of that we got it to display not sure if we did it right for task
						X though would like some feedback possibly the right way to do it for future assignments/group project.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, we are very pleased with our code and site layout.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output">
						<script type="text/javascript" src="js/lab.js"></script>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p>For displaying it we were able to access the ID from the html file however in order to do so we had to move the script tag at least within
							the ID div. We read somewhere that the ID tag has to load in first and in order for the script tag to see it or something like that.
