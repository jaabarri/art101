					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>To pseudocode a mini game, we choose cops and robbers.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>It was challening to incorperate the pseudocode in java script, more specifically adding comments, the formatting portion was tricky to figure out.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, we like our mini game idea and now understand pseudocoding to a better extent.

// Cops and Robbers Game
// An implementation of the game
// Leyton and Jacob 
// October 2023
//# Pseudocode for a Cops vs. Robbers Game

//# Initialize game variables
//Create a map
//Create a list of players
//Create a list of items (e.g., weapons, money)
//Initialize player locations on the map
//Initialize item locations on the map

//# Game loop
//While true:
  //  # Display the game map
    //Display the map with player and item locations

    //# Check for game over conditions
    //If all robbers are caught or all money is stolen:
      //  Display a message indicating the game is over
        //Exit the game loop

    //# Allow players to take actions
    //For each player in players:
      //  If the player is a cop:
        //    Allow the cop to move or arrest a robber
        //If the player is a robber:
          //  Allow the robber to move or steal money

   // # Update player and item locations
    //Update player positions based on their actions
    //Update item positions if items are stolen or moved

    //# Check for player interactions
    //For each pair of players on the same location:
      //  If a cop is on the same location as a robber:
        //    Arrest the robber, remove them from the game
        //If a robber is on the same location as money:
          //  Steal the money

    //# Check for other events
    //Randomly generate events (e.g., police reinforcements, new items)
    //Handle special events

    //# Check for game over conditions (again)
    //If all robbers are caught or all money is stolen:
      //  Display a message indicating the game is over
        //Exit the game loop

//# End of the game
//Display the final result (cops win or robbers win)
