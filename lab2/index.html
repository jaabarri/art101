			<h1>Lab 2 - HTML and CSS Starter</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We had to create a basic HTML and a CSS file. Then, we tinkered with it and viewed it in the browser till it was completed. 
						Lastly, we inspected it to overlook our work.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>	
					<p> We had a hard time editing the code at the same time, so Jacob did most of the file editing and screenshots.
						Our TA didn't know how to edit the document together either. Leyton helped out by giving suggestions, creating content, 
						and creating the layout of the google document.</p>
